About:
- summing up variances (as sampling)
- n-1 case

- why it is working: the magic of mean makes the equation work like: (x - mu)^2 = x^2 - mu^2  (if it were not mean, we would expect (x - mu)^2 = x^2 - 2*mu*x +  mu^2

- variance decomposition (how means are distributed + how observations are distributed around the mean)
- relation to Chi_sq: we have a normal distribution - it's always possible to calculate how squared differences would behave. 
- could play with some distribution of how it could look like if we chose to go for absolute differences (and not squared)
