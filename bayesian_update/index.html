Article Bayesian update

take a prior. It is a distribution. It is distributed all across the x (returning some probability for each x)
Obtain likelihood. It is also a distribution. All across the x. (Think about drawing prior and real data together or for each observation?)
The denominator is just the sum of prior*likelihood across all possible x (called marginal)
One shift is that you should think about expressions like P() not as numbers but as distributions
Open questions:
	⁃	do not understand how it updates
	⁃	Do not understand how it relates to simpler Bayes examples
	⁃	In general Bayes form - I do not understand the physical sense of denominator
