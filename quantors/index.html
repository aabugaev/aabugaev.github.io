At school you do normal equations. You probably tried logic
1 year of calculus brings combination of both. How to live with it?
Show stuff with example of small equation like: x+y=6
First, with regular equations you just show what is the set that is defined by that conditions
But quantors bring us to the field of logic. Meaning that you can either show it is true or false.
And to prove statements with logic you have to follow the rules of how variables under quantors relate. (Can plot a graph of variable relations)
But what if algebra and logic get combined? Like in definition of a limit?
is just x+y=6 different from the same expression, but when quantors are there?
We could think about some opportunities to quantify the expression:
ExEy:x+y=6
AxAy:x+y=6
In all of them we can give a set which makes an expression true or false.
However is finding the set enough? Actually not!
What also matters in quantors and does not matter in regular algebra is how you define the variables.
So the variables standing with ALL quantor cannot depend on anything. This means that you cannot say that it is defined using any other variable.
And the variables with EXISTS quantor can either be defined on their own (just say, it is x=1, you just found it) or using the variables standing before them in quantor expression (delta = epsilon*3)
NOTE: when working with quantors, it is important how you define the variables:
x+y=6  has multiple solutions.
You can solve saying: take arbitrary x. To find y do 6-x
If you have AyEx:x+y=6
You cannot say: “take arbitrary x. To find y do 6-x”. The set fits correctly to algebraic equation, but it does not work to prove the logical expression. It does not satisfy the graph (for all y there is an x)
You can only say:
Take arbitrary y. Define x as 6-y (it is important how you define / take arbitrary variables here)
So to conclude, if you have a quantor + algebraic expression, to prove it, you need
a set for which the expression holds
The variables under quantors are declared following the rules above
